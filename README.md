# Redis clone in rust

A toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`, etc. Built to get familiar about
concurrent programming, implementing the redis protocol, and more. Created as a part of ["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

## Supported Commands
- PING
- ECHO
- SET
- GET
- LPUSH
- RPUSH
- LRANGE

## Building

Run `cargo run` to start the server. You can use the official redis CLI to interact with this.

## TODO
- More array stuff
- Persistent storage
- Organize code
